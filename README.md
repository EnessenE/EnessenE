- 👋 Hi, I’m @EnessenE
- 👀 I’m interested in anything remotely IT related and in making people interact with technology
- 🛠️ A passion for programming & infrastructure
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about messaging platforms and IoT
- 📫 If you really badly want to contact me through then twitter may be an option if need be. The account is barely used but I do receive notifications!

You can find alot of side and old school projects here, while not per se representative of what I can do they hopefully do show you I know what I am doing.
